Things not done / incomplete

Approval controls

Currently, the template shows applications and status, but there’s no working approve/reject button or backend logic yet.

Update application status

The view doesn’t have functionality to change status from pending → approved/rejected.

Reports

Admissions reports (e.g., total applications, approved/rejected counts)

Student performance reports (grades, attendance if applicable)

Statistics reports (applications by class, etc.)

Admin integration

If you want staff/admin actions inside Django’s admin site, that may not be configured yet.

Permissions / access control

Only staff should access the staff dashboard, approve/reject applications, and view reports.

📝 Suggested next steps

Add approve/reject actions

Buttons in the template

POST request to a view that updates app.status

Add reports views

Use aggregate() and annotate() in Django ORM for summaries

Test staff permissions

Use @login_required and @user_passes_test decorators or django.contrib.auth.models.Group

Optional: integrate staff actions into Django admin

If you want, I can draft the exact approve/reject functionality and a simple admissions report view that you can plug into your staff module next.

Do you want me to do that?
